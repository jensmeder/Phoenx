# Phoenx

Phoenx generates Xcode projects (`*.xcodeproj`) and workspaces (`*.xcworkspace`) for iOS, OSX, and tvOS using specification and xcconfig files. Specify your project once and never worry about broken Xcode projects or merge conflicts in pbxproj files ever again. 

#### Example

```ruby

Phoenx::Project.new do |s|
		
	s.project_name = "DarkLightning"
	
	# Set up project wide xcconfig files
	
	s.config_files["Debug"] = "Configuration/Shared/debug.xcconfig"
	s.config_files["Release"] = "Configuration/Shared/release.xcconfig"
	
	# When true, changes are avoided when regenerating the project file (useful when tracking it in version control)
	# When you see a "Generated duplicate UUIDs" warning after enabling this option, please create a bug report at https://github.com/jensmeder/Phoenx/issues.
	s.deterministic_project = true 

	# Add a new OSX framework target
	
	s.target "OSX", :framework, :osx, '10.11' do |target|
	
		target.config_files["Debug"] = "Configuration/OSX/debug.xcconfig"
		target.config_files["Release"] = "Configuration/OSX/release.xcconfig"
		
		# Add files to target
		
		target.support_files = ["Configuration/**/*.{xcconfig,plist}"]
		target.sources = "Source/Sockets/**/*.{h,m}", "Source/USB/**/*.{h,m,c}","Source/PacketProtocol/**/*.{h,m}", "Source/Internal/**/*.{h,m}"
		target.public_headers = "Source/OSX/**/*.{h}","Source/USB/*.{h}","Source/PacketProtocol/**/*.{h}","Source/USB/Connections/**/*.{h}"
		target.private_headers = ["Source/Sockets/**/*.{h}", "Source/USB/USBMux/**/*.{h}"]
		
		# Generate an umbrella header

			# Path to the file that should be generated
		target.umbrella_header = "Source/OSX/DarkLightning.h"
			
			# Optional: Defining the module name (results in `#import <Module/Header.h>` in comparison to `#import "Header.h"`)
		target.module_name = "DarkLightning"

		# Add a unit test target
		
		target.unittest_target "OSX-Tests" do |t|
		
			t.sources = ["Tests/**/*.{h,m,c}"]
			t.frameworks = ["Frameworks/Kiwi/Kiwi.framework"]
			t.config_files["Debug"] = "Configuration/OSXTests/debug.xcconfig"
			t.config_files["Release"] = "Configuration/OSXTests/release.xcconfig"
		
		end
	
		# Add a ui test target

		target.uitest_target "OSX-Tests" do |s|
		
			s.sources = ["UITests/**/*.{h,m,c}"]
			s.config_files["Debug"] = "Configuration/OSXUITests/debug.xcconfig"
			s.config_files["Release"] = "Configuration/OSXUITests/release.xcconfig"
		
		end

	end

end

```

As soon as you run `phoenx project build` Phoenx will generate a new `xcodeproj` file based on the above definition. Easy as that!
